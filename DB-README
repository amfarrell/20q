2) download the database from
http://conceptnet.media.mit.edu/dist/ConceptNet-sqlite.tar.gz
unzip and untar the file then `mv ConceptNet.db twentyq.db`
 -> this works, but requires downloading conceptnet and ultimately
wont work as far as actually installing on the production site


This is the database for ConceptNet 4.0. You will probably want to use it
together with the ConceptNet API, available from
http://launchpad.net/conceptnet.

you should have this on your python path in your virtualenv,
so remember to run
cscpython manage.py runserver

Is there a better way to do this?
